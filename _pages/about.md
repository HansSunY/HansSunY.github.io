I am currently a first-year MS student at [IMCCLab@USTC](https://imcc.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) supervised by Prof. Hongtao Xie and [Prof. Yongdong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hxGs4ukAAAAJ). Before this, I got my Bachelor degree at [School of Cyber Science and Technology](https://cybersec.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), USTC. 

My research interests include computer vision and AI security. Currently Iâ€™m working on facial privacy and safe & responsible generative model. You can find my CV [here](/assets/Yuhao_Sun_cv.pdf).
